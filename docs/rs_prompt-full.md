Create a new file named architect.md. 
This file should outline the architecture of our project. Include sections for:
1. **Code Analysis**:
   - Identify all Java classes, their packages, and relationships (inheritance, dependencies, associations).
   - Detect Spring Boot components (e.g., @RestController, @Service, @Repository, @Entity).
   - Analyze configuration files (e.g., pom.xml, application.properties, application.yml).
   - Identify key functionalities (e.g., REST endpoints, database interactions, business logic).

2. **Generate Documentation**:
   - Create a Markdown file named architecture.md into chat.
   - Include the following sections:
     - **System Overview**: Summarize the projectâ€™s purpose, architecture (e.g., microservice, monolithic), and key components.
     - **Class Diagram**: Use PlantUML to create a class diagram showing all classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships (e.g., inheritance, @Autowired dependencies).
     - **Sequence Diagrams**: For each major REST endpoint or business process, generate a PlantUML sequence diagram showing interactions between components (e.g., Controller -> Service -> Repository).
     - **Component Diagram**: Use PlantUML to show the high-level microservice architecture, including services, databases, and external integrations.
     - **API Documentation**: List all REST endpoints with their HTTP methods, paths, request/response formats, and descriptions.
     - **Setup Instructions**: Provide steps to set up and run the project locally (e.g., `mvn spring-boot:run`, database configuration).
     - **Database Schema**: If the project uses a database, describe the schema (tables, relationships) with a PlantUML ER diagram.

3. **PlantUML Integration**:
   - Embed PlantUML code in the Markdown file using ```plantuml code blocks.
   - Ensure diagrams are clear, using appropriate themes (e.g., `!theme crt-amber`) for readability.
   - For GitHub compatibility, include instructions to render diagrams using a PlantUML server (e.g., http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml).

4. **Output**:
   
   - Ensure the documentation is beginner-friendly, with clear explanations for new developers.
   - Include a table of contents and links to related sections.
   

5. **Validation**:
   - Verify that all diagrams are syntactically correct and renderable.
   - Ensure no sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords) from configuration files is included.
